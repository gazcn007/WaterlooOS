<h1>Installing OS/161 On Your Own Machine</h1>

<p>
The following instructions describe how to install OS/161
on machines that are outside of the
student.cs computing environment.
These instructions assume that the target machine is running
Linux.
</p><p>
If you are trying to
install OS/161 in the student.cs computing environment,
then these are not the instructions for you.
There is <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/Install161.html">another set of instructions</a>,
much simpler than this set, for working in the student.cs environment.
</p><p>
<b>
For marking purposes, your code will be compiled and executed in the
CSCF undergraduate (student.cs) environment. You are responsible for
ensuring that your code runs there.
</b></p><p>
<b>
Getting OS/161 and related tools running on your Linux machine should not
be too difficult.
However, this is not a guarantee - there are too many
variables beyond our control.  Ensuring that OS/161 runs in the
student.cs environment is our responsibility. Getting it running on your
machine is yours.
</b>
</p><p>
Setting up OS/161 on your own machine is more involved than
setting it up in your account in the student.cs environment.
In the student.cs enviroment, both the sys/161 simulator
(on which OS/161 runs) and the associated toolchain (compiler,
debugger, binary utilities) are set up in the CS350 course
account and can be used from there.
To run OS/161 on your home machine, you will need to download
and build your own copies of the simulator and the toolchain
before you can work with OS/161.

<h3>Step 0: Please be aware of the FAQ</h3>
<p>
If things go wrong please have a look at the FAQ
for answers and solutions.
In particular most systems require the installation
of additional software and/or libraries.
This will vary by Linux distro and/or Mac OS X version
and we'll try to collect information in the FAQ.

<h3>Step 2: Build and Install the Binary Utilities (Binutils)</h3>

Unpack the binutils archive:
<br>
<kbd>
tar -xzf os161-binutils.tar.gz
</kbd>
<br>
Move into the newly-created directory:
<br>
<kbd>
cd binutils-2.17+os161-2.0.1
</kbd>
<br>
Configure binutils:
<br>
<kbd>
./configure --nfp --disable-werror --target=mips-harvard-os161 --prefix=$HOME/sys161/tools
</kbd>
<br>
Make binutils:
<br>
<kbd>
make
</kbd>
<br>
If the <tt>make</tt> command fails because of a problem related
to <tt>makeinfo</tt>, try running the following command:
<br>
<kbd>
find . -name '*.info' | xargs touch
</kbd>
<br>
and then re-run <tt>make</tt>.
<br>
Finally, once <tt>make</tt> has succeeded, install the binutils into
their final location:
<br>
<kbd>
make install
</kbd>
<br>
This will create the directory <tt>$HOME/sys161/tools/</tt>
and populate it.
<p></p>

<h3>Step 3: Adjust Your Shell's Command Path</h3>

First, make the directory in which your shell will
eventually find the toolchain binaries:
<br>
<kbd>
mkdir $HOME/sys161/bin
</kbd>
<br>
Next, add two directories (<tt>$HOME/sys161/bin</tt> and
<tt>$HOME/sys161/tools/bin</tt>) to your shell's search path.
Users of <tt>bash</tt> should do something
like this in your <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and <tt>.bashrc</tt> files
in your home directory: 
<br>
<kbd>
export PATH=$HOME/sys161/bin:$HOME/sys161/tools/bin:$PATH
</kbd>
<br>
while users of <tt>csh</tt>  or <tt>tcsh</tt> would typically use <tt>.profile</tt>
and <tt>.cshrc</tt> (in your home directory):
<br>
<kbd>
setenv PATH $HOME/sys161/bin:$HOME/sys161/tools/bin:${PATH}
</kbd>
<br>

<br>
<font color="red">
Note that setting these variables in <tt>.bashrc</tt> and <tt>.cshrc</tt> only
works in the shell or window in which you issue the above commands in, and will
most likely NOT work for logging in through SSH. You will need to ensure that
the proper path is set and used for future logins and for other newly created
shells.

<br>
<a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/Shell-Setup.html">
A bit more information about setting up your shell.
</a>
</font>

<p>
Note that you may need to log out and log back in again
so that this <tt>PATH</tt> change will take effect.
You can check the current setting of the <tt>PATH</tt> environment
variable using the command
<br><br>
<kbd>
printenv PATH
</kbd>
</p>


<h3>Step 4: Install the GCC MIPS Cross-Compiler</h3>

Unpack the gcc archive:
<br>
<kbd>
tar -xzf os161-gcc.tar.gz
</kbd>
<br>
Move into the newly-created directory:
<br>
<kbd>
cd gcc-4.1.2+os161-2.0
</kbd>
<br>
Configure gcc
<br>
<kbd>
./configure -nfp --disable-shared --disable-threads --disable-libmudflap --disable-libssp --target=mips-harvard-os161 --prefix=$HOME/sys161/tools
</kbd>
<br>
Make it and install it:
<br>
<kbd>
make
</kbd>
<br>
<kbd>
make install
</kbd>
<br>

<h3>Step 5: Install GDB</h3>

Unpack the gdb archive:
<br>
<kbd>
tar -xzf os161-gdb.tar.gz
</kbd>
<br>
Move into the newly-created directory:
<br>
<kbd>
cd gdb-6.6+os161-2.0
</kbd>
<br>
Configure gdb
<br>
<kbd>
./configure --target=mips-harvard-os161 --prefix=$HOME/sys161/tools --disable-werror
</kbd>
<br>
Make it and install it:
<br>
<kbd>
make
</kbd><br>
<kbd>
make install
</kbd>
<br>
<p>
	<b>Note:</b>
	Compiling this version of GDB may fail when newer versions of the texinfo
	package are installed (version 5.2-1, for instance). If you encounter an issue
	with this step, you can either include <tt>MAKEINFO=missing</tt> when you run
	the <tt>make</tt> command, or you can install an older version of texinfo (such
	as 4.13-4) and try again. You may also need to install the libncurses-devel
	library.
</p>

<h3>Step 6: Install bmake</h3>

Unpack the bmake archive:
<br>
<kbd>
tar -xzf os161-bmake.tar.gz
</kbd>
<br>
Move into the newly-created directory:
<br>
<kbd>
cd bmake
</kbd>
<br>
Unpack mk within the bmake directory:
<br>
<kbd>
tar -xzf ../os161-mk.tar.gz
</kbd>
<br>
Run the bmake bootstrap script
<br>
<kbd>
./boot-strap --prefix=$HOME/sys161/tools
</kbd>
<br>
As the <tt>boot-strap</tt> script finishes, it should print a list of
commands that you can run to install bmake
under <tt>$HOME/sys161/tools</tt>.
The list should look something like this:
<br>
<kbd>
mkdir -p /home/kmsalem/sys161/tools/bin<br>
cp /home/kmsalem/bmake/Linux/bmake /home/kmsalem/sys161/tools/bin/bmake-20101215<br>
rm -f /home/kmsalem/sys161/tools/bin/bmake<br>
ln -s bmake-20101215 /home/kmsalem/sys161/tools/bin/bmake<br>
mkdir -p /home/kmsalem/sys161/tools/share/man/cat1<br>
cp /home/kmsalem/bmake/bmake.cat1 /home/kmsalem/sys161/tools/share/man/cat1/bmake.1<br>
sh /home/kmsalem/bmake/mk/install-mk /home/kmsalem/sys161/tools/share/mk<br>
</kbd>
Of course, your output will refer to your directories, not
to <tt>/home/kmsalem</tt>.
<p>
Run the commands printed by <tt>boot-strap</tt> in the order in which
they are listed.
<br>

</p><h3>Step 7: Set Up Links for Toolchain Binaries</h3>

<kbd>
mkdir $HOME/sys161/bin
</kbd><br>
<kbd>
cd $HOME/sys161/tools/bin
</kbd><br>
<kbd>
sh -c 'for i in mips-*; do ln -s $HOME/sys161/tools/bin/$i $HOME/sys161/bin/cs350-`echo $i | cut -d- -f4-`; done'
</kbd><br>
<kbd>
ln -s $HOME/sys161/tools/bin/bmake $HOME/sys161/bin/bmake
</kbd>
<p>
<b>Cygwin Users:</b> Shells under Cygwin sometimes have difficulty handling shell
commands in a string input as given above. If you find yourself unable to get the second 
command to work, copy and paste the entire second line into a shell script in <tt>$HOME/sys161/tools/bin</tt>
and run it from there. You will likely need to change the permissions on the shell script to allow it to run, as follows:
</p>
<kbd>
chmod 755 myscript.sh
</kbd>
<p>
When you are finished with these steps, a listing of the
directory <tt>$HOME/sys161/bin</tt> should look similar to this:
</p><pre>bmake@            cs350-gcc@        cs350-ld@       cs350-run@
cs350-addr2line@  cs350-gcc-4.1.2@  cs350-nm@       cs350-size@
cs350-ar@         cs350-gccbug@     cs350-objcopy@  cs350-strings@
cs350-as@         cs350-gcov@       cs350-objdump@  cs350-strip@
cs350-c++filt@    cs350-gdb@        cs350-ranlib@
cs350-cpp@        cs350-gdbtui@     cs350-readelf@
</pre>

<h3>Step 8: Build and Install the sys161 Simulator</h3>

Unpack the sys161 archive:
<br>
<kbd>
tar -xzf sys161.tar.gz
</kbd>
<br>
Move into the newly-created directory:
<br>
<kbd>
cd sys161-1.99.06
</kbd>
<br>
Next, configure sys161:
<br>
<kbd>
./configure --prefix=$HOME/sys161 mipseb
</kbd>
<br>
Build sys161 and install it:
<br>
<kbd>
make<br>
make install
</kbd>
<br>
Finally, set up a link to a sample sys161 configuration file<br>
<kbd>
cd $HOME/sys161
</kbd><br>
<kbd>
ln -s share/examples/sys161/sys161.conf.sample sys161.conf
</kbd>

<h3>Step 9: Install OS/161</h3>

First, create a directory to hold the OS/161 source code, your
compiled OS/161 kernels, and related test programs.
<br>
<kbd>
cd $HOME<br>
mkdir cs350-os161
</kbd>
<br>
Next, move the OS/161 archive into your new directory and 
unpack it:
<br>
<kbd>
mv os161.tar.gz cs350-os161<br>
cd cs350-os161<br>
tar -xzf os161.tar.gz
</kbd>
<br>
This will create a directory called <tt>os161-1.99</tt>
(under <tt>cs350-os161</tt>) containing the OS/161 source
code.  
You should now be able build, install, and run
an OS/161 kernel and related application and test programs
by following steps similar to 
<a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/Install161.html">those used to install OS/161
in the student.cs computing environment</a>, starting
with the step "Configure and Build OS/161".

<h3>Step 10: Cleanup (optional)</h3>

Once you have completed the above steps, your OS/161-related
development tools (binutils, gcc, gdb) and the sys/161 simulator
will be installed under <tt>$HOME/sys161</tt>, and OS/161 itself
will be installed under <tt>$HOME/cs350-os161</tt>. 
The archive files (filenames ending in <tt>.tar.gz</tt>)
that you downloaded in <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/Install161NonCS.html#download">Step 1</a>
are no longer needed, so feel free to remove them if you want
to save space or reduce clutter.
You can also remove the directories in which you unpacked
the archives and built the software:
<tt>binutils-2.17+os161-2.0.1</tt>,
<tt>gcc-4.1.2+os161-2.0</tt>,
<tt>gdb-6.6+os161-2.0</tt>,
<tt>bmake</tt> and 
<tt>sys161-1.99.06</tt>.
However, do not delete the OS/161 source code
(under <tt>$HOME/cs350-os161/os161-1.99</tt>), since you will be making
use of it for your assignments.
<p> 
Optionally, you may also remove the directory <tt>$HOME/sys161/tools/bin</tt> from your shell command path, as it is needed only during the process of building the toolchain.  However, you be sure to leave
<tt>$HOME/sys161/bin</tt> in your path, as that is the home of the toolchain binaries that you will be using as you work with OS/161.
</p>
